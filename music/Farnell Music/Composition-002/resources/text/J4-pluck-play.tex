\paragraph{slapback delay}
An important part of bringing this sound alive is the rather short
delay time and feedback, half a beat, a common effect on
twangy guitar and short percussives and often called a "slapback"
delay. Delays shorter than a beat mimic early reverb reflections
instead of distinct echos and can add a closeness to the sound.
