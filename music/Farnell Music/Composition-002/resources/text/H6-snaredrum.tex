\paragraph{4 parameters}
Each of four parameters is unpacked and connected to
its destination in the DSP. The first parameter
sets the top of the sweep range and the second
sets the minimum with  \verb+[* ]+ and \verb@[+ ]@
units respectively. Parameter 3 goes directly
to the resonance inlet of filter \verb+[bp~ 400 2 ]+.


\paragraph{signals}
The signal source is
\verb+[noise~ ]+, which is modified by the filter. Notice that
the control signals for the filter cutoff are not at audio rate.
Message domain control is used because \verb+[bp~ ]+ cutoff is a message rate inlet.
However, we convert the amplitude control to a smoothed signal at the last moment,
\verb+[lop~]+ is used to remove any sudden jumps.
