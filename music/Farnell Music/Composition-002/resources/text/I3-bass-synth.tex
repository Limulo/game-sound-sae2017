\paragraph{parameter substitution}
In this wrapper you can see we have used an abstraction for a synth called
\verb+[z-3cosynth]+, and a message that holds all the parameters
for a certain sound except the note number, which is substituted in.
For synths that receive all their parameters on each note, note time
initialised, we can use a message as a patch template and 
substitute new parameters on the fly by substitution. An alternative is to
have each control with its own independent inlet. There are pros and cons 
to both methods in terms of flexibility and the amount of data sent
on each note (and hence stored somewhere when sequencing). Don't worry
about the contents of \verb+[z-3cosynth]+ at this point, it is a
synth with 3 cosines, and all we need to know is that the parameters
in the message give us a nice fat analogue bass sound.
