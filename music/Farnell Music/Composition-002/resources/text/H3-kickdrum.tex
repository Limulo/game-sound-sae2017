\paragraph{three kick sounds}
This wrapper modifies the performance of the kick drum synth
by storing three preset sounds, long and low, medium, shorter and higher.
On each received beat one is selected at random, including a rest where
no kick plays at all. Note how this behaviour is built in to the
instrument now, not the sequence as we have defined it. 
Combined with a measure of uncertainty for individual beats in the previous 
patch the result is a much sparser pattern than you might expect.
