\paragraph{strange harmonics}
This part sounds quite weird alone. It was designed with the rest
of the mix playing and fits in by offering some tones that are
inharmonic and much more organic than the rest.
It has an ambiguous timbre, sometimes stringy and sometimes more brass-like,
but it does the job of pulling together some of the more disparate
higher bits by providing ground between them.
