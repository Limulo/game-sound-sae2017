\paragraph{tones for composing with}
When setting the mood for a piece by choosing some
chords it often helps to use "big" sounds.
Rich sounds in certain timbres suggest things
harmonically. Pure sine waves don't give the potential
for suggesting harmonically related chords because they
have no overtones of their own. A way to get a richer sound
from fairly weak sawtooth waves is to employ a chorus or
vari-delay effect. 

\paragraph{deep swirly effect}
Instead of a regular lfo that sweeps back and forth over
a fixed period we have a wandering control signal. This 
is used to sweep two bandpass filters with a slightly less
bright version going to the delay. Delay unit \verb+[vd~ $0-ffff]+
is a vari-rate delay with its time in the range 10 ms to 50 ms and
swept by the same wandering signal. This results is a rather
old fashioned, warped kind of effect with occasional fast
excursion that make the sound go out of tune.
