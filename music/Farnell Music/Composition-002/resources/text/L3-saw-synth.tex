\paragraph{detuned saws and filter}
There's quite a lot to see in this synth and it's layout is 
not easy to read. Basically, two phasors are at the
core of the sound, detuned from each other so that one lags
behind the other when they move but they eventually reach the
same value. The summed phasors are filtered with 
bandpass \verb+[bp~ 100 1]+ and clipped \verb+[clip~ -0.9 0.9]+. The 
filter resonance is set quite high by an incoming parameter.
