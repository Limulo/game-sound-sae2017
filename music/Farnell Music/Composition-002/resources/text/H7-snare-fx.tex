\paragraph{delay and sweep filter}
These effects are a slowly moving filter on top of a delay 
unit (which we will examine in the next section). A \verb+[loadbang]+
sets up an initial delay time, fixed to 375ms here, and
feedback (60 percent), as well as setting the initial resonance
of \verb+[vcf~]+ which prefers to be set up this way.

\paragraph{low frequency oscillator}
An lfo can simply be a normal oscillator running very slow when
you want audio rate control signals. The cutoff frequency of 
\verb+[vcf~]+ is set by an audio signal which gives a much
smoother change of settings. If a control rate filter
adjustment is used here at such a low frequency we would certainly hear 
occasional clicks with a \verb+[bp~ ]+ unit. The lfo sweeps up
in one direction between 300Hz and 5300Hz about every 2 seconds.
