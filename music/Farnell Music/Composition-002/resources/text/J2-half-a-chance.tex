\paragraph{half a chance}
We keep using the technique of choosing an event based on
a half probability. Let's make that an abstraction and choose
a smarter way to do it. Instead of passing a values with
a spigot after they are chosen (with certainty), remove events
from a stream before they trigger anything. It's very
simple, for each bang on the inlet choose \verb+[random 2]+, value of 
0 or 1, and \verb+[select 1]+ to get only half of them.
