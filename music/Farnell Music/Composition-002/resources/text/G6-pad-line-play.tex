\paragraph{sound of the pad synth}
Only one fader is up on the GUI, panned to the middle.
There are no other parts in the piece at present.
Experiment with panning and fading the part. Test out the
on/off (unmute buttons) and resetting the timebase. Try
putting different notes in the score chord lists.
