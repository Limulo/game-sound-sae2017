\paragraph{4 sounds}
In an identical fashion to the kick drums, some
snare drum random variation. There is a 1/3 chance that no
beat will play. On the remaining 2/3 of beats one of 4 possible
parameter messages is sent. The values represent filter amount,
filter base, filter resonance and total amplitude. As you
can see there is a mixture of short, long, high and low values
in the four messages.
