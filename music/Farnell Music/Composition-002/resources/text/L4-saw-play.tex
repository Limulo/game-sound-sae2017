\paragraph{occasional swoops}
Few occurances of this sparse part occur in the composition.
It also varies quite a lot as the last state of
of the oscillators makes a difference to how the next note will
play out. Sometimes you hear it sweep right up to the limits of
the keyboard and then back to zero where it makes a clicking noise
as the phasor frequency gets very low.
