\paragraph{experimental string sound}
Just to show that you don't always have to break up your code into
neat boxes for synths, sequencer and effects here is a strange
instrument that is all in the same abstraction. It uses the familiar
\verb+[z-3cosynth]+ and operates on notes 7 and 8 of the chord an
octave down. 

\paragraph{random parameters}
Sometimes when exploring a new synth you might like to hook up
a set of objects as on the top right of this patch, which generate
random parameters within a fixed range. This setup produces
a constantly changing variation on a string-like sound, somewhat
hollow and scrapey. See how the dynamic parameters are freely interleaved with fixed
ones in the substitution.
