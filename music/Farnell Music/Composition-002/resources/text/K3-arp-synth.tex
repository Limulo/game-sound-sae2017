\paragraph{sliding sounds}
This is portamento, where a note always travels
between its last value and the new one, as opposed to
glissando where the note rises or falls consistently
from some value to the target note.
Slide time and decay are related so that
quick slides have a short envelope and long slides have a matching
long envelope. This sound has an interesting effect when combined
with the sustained notes of the pad.
