\paragraph{Play the bassline}
The bass synth, bass line sequencer and timebase abstractions 
\verb+[A-timebase]+, \verb+[B-synth1]+, and \verb+[C-bassline-seq]+
work together in this patch to make a sound.
Audio signals are sent using \verb+[throw~]+
and \verb+[catch~]+ objects, so that we can combine many synths as we go.
There is link below to a soundfile of this sequence. Notice the very
basic envelope produces clicks with such low frequencies.

\paragraph{Broadcasting variables}
The patch is split up to make adding more synths easier. Floats from
the timebase are sent between \verb+[s time]+ and \verb+[r time]+
objects, send and receive. Think of these as bluetooth adaptors or
invisible cables for puredata signals, they exist in unique pairs,
several \verb+[send]+ transmitters cannot share a \verb+[receive]+
