\paragraph{catch main bus}
\verb+[catch~ left]+ and \verb+[catch~ right]+ pick up from 
two globally visible main signals "left" and "right" which
are driven by \verb+[throw~]+ objects. Here both are
multiplied by a simple line with 20ms slew for a fast but slightly
less clicky fade action. Outputs for the \verb+[dac~]+ are specified
explicitly, but you don't have to do this unless working with multi channel audio.
