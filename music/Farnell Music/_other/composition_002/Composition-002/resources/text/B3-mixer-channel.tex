\paragraph{many channels}
This abstraction is repeated many times in the composition, it's a mixer channel
that sends to the main bus using \verb+[throw~]+. It has it's own \verb+[line~]+
unit which is controlled via \verb+[inlet volume]+ and \verb+[inlet pan]+ which
carries a value in degrees from -90 to +90. In this case we have made an unusual
compromise between mono and stereo sources by having a stereo signal panned midfield
at a width of 60 degrees, which leaves it 120 degrees of movement.
