\paragraph{old style electro drums}
This kind of sound is typical of electronic
music circa 1979/80, like Kraftwerk (Autobahn), Ultravox (Vienna) or early
Human League (Being Boiled). Resonant noise sweeps in the lower ranges
have quite a powerful sound. 

\paragraph{beat density} 
It's hard to pin down this beat.
With just enough randomness the actual beat is unclear on first
listening to the drums alone, it seems to mutate around a bunch
of similar patterns. This effect is helped lots by the delay. It
doesn't really make sense until we also have a bassline to
anchor key points with, so let's build a bass line in the
next section.
