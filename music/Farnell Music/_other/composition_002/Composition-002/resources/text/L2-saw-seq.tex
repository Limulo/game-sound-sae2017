\paragraph{non root notes}
All the notes above 1 and 2 are unpacked from the chord. This composition
originally had 10 and 12 note chords and there are two redundant
values unpacked. Sometimes as a piece evolves, not every
part of stays consistent and interesting "features" may be
happened upon by accident. The result here should to get an extra two
rests, but in fact we occasionally get a zero value note since the redundant floats
are set to 0. I decided to keep this "bug" as part of the composition because
when the note dives to zero it makes a very nice effect.

\paragraph{selection}
Two cycles of time are used here, a 16 beat bar and a 64 beat one. This is 
to add an extra few beats on 57, 61 and the last beat of each 4 regular
bars. There are two synth patches selected in the sequencer. Notice parameter substitution 
occurs here in the sequencer this time, not in the synth, so we can choose different sounds
on different beats.
