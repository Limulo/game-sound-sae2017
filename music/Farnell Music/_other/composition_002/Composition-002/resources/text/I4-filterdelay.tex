\paragraph{another effect}
Can you spot the important difference between this and the last effect?
The filter comes after the delay now. Reordering of
effects units makes a big difference to the overall result. This time
I've added a \verb+[lop~]+ to the \verb+[phasor~]+ so that when it
flies back to zero there isn't a very sudden change in cutoff. For this effect
an extra inlet is included to vary filter resonance.
