\paragraph{two select units}
When placing beats you don't have to use one \verb+[select]+ object
and insert each beat in the right order, that would be most
frustrating, instead its okay to just add more \verb+[select]+ 
operations for new beats as needed. Here the first and
second bar are handled by different \verb+[select]+ units.

\paragraph{skip some beats}
Beats 2, 7 and 10 do not play every time.
A \verb+[spigot]+ is like a valve, it lets its input through to the output
whenever a 1 message appears at its right inlet, and continues to do so
until it is sent a 0 message. The messages on the left inlet are then
blocked and do not appear at the output. Here a \verb+[random 2]+ unit
in combination with a spigot permits one in every two beats to pass through.
