\paragraph{long saw sweeps}
This type of sound features in some Pink Floyd songs and became 
popular again in 90s chillout/ambient music of artists like
Namlook and Morris. It is a resonant saw pitch sweep going
right beyond the normal range and used at the start or end
of several bars to add new energy or a lead in to a new section.
