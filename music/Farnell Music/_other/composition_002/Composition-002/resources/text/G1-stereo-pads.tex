\paragraph{First synthesiser wrapper}
This patch is typical of a wrapper. It is mainly a way to tuck two or three
related things in a box together. We have a synth part which is going to play some
audio and all the global messages needed to make that work, in this case only
\verb+[r chords]+, and we have a mixer channel with a few extras to implement a 
channel mute.
