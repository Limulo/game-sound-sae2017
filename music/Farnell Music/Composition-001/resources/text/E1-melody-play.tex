\paragraph{Play the melody}
The melody sequencer and synth 2 produce this sound. Listen to the
soundfile below. Hear the more "hollow" sounding square wave blip
cycle forever over 4 notes. Changing the attack to 12ms reduces the
click when frequency changes, and the higher pitch of this part
make fast changes less obvious.
