\paragraph{Two bars or more}
To extend a number of sequencers by chaining them together \verb+[moses]+ is a very useful
object. The idiom shown, \verb+[moses n]+\verb+[- n]+, is repeatable to create chains of
events distributed along the same counter timeline. In this case two subpatches are chained together to produce two bars,
32 beats in total. While the input to \verb+[moses 16]+ is less than 16 floats will
be sent to its left outlet. Note values of 16 and above will appear on the right outlet.
If we subtract 16 from the second stream both now count over the 16 step range 0 to 15,
but at different times thus we have created a system to chain bars together. 
Two drum patterns using \verb+[select]+ are stored in separate subpatches, one for each bar.
