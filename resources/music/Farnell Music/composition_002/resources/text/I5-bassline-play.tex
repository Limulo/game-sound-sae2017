\paragraph{bass line sound}
Maybe there is a hint of Korg CS or Yamaha MS about this sound, or 
the Korg Monopoly with 4 oscillators. Richness comes from
clipping 3 closely detuned cosine generators to highlight
their intermodulation. With filter-delay echoing each note
the result is a more blended and continuous bass backing.
