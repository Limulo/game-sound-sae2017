\paragraph{parameters}
Two parameters are passed for each kick sound, a decay time
and a pitch range. This list is unpacked first from the 
list output of \verb+[t b b l]+ with the first decay value going
to the inlet of a \verb+[pack]+ object and the second going
to the set the frequency sweep scale.

\paragraph{envelope}
A more complicated arrangement of messages for this
envelope shows the simplicity, and limitation, of \verb+[line~]+. In order
to have a non-zero attack we need to hold off the decay message
for at least as long as the attack rise. This is done with a message
delay \verb+[del 2]+ giving a 2ms delay to the bang message.

\paragraph{signals}
The signal is an sine wave with amplitude and frequency as
functions of the fourth power of the falling line segment. Frequency
is down to a minimum of 20Hz, and as high as the second parameter passed.
Amplitude is always from full to zero, decaying in the time set by the first
parameter.
