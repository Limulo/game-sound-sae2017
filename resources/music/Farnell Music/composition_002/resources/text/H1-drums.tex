\paragraph{mixer channel}
As usual there is a mixer channel at the bottom of this wrapper. There are
two instruments in here, a kick and snare drum, one panned to the left
and one to the right. The channel is controlled by fader 2 and pan 2.

\paragraph{parts}

Five abstractions make up the patch, a sequencer for the kick drum pattern
and a kick drum synth, and the same for the snare drum plus an effects
patch.
