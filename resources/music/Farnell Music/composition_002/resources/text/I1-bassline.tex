\paragraph{sequencer, synth and delay}
Again a top level wrapper for a bassline part. This arrangement
should be familiar by now, you can encapsulate the sequencer, synth,
effects and mixer channel all in the same place. Delay effects
are set to twice the global period with a 60 percent feedback amount.
This instrument will be controlled by fader 3.
