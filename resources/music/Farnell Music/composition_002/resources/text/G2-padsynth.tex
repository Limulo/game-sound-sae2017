\paragraph{synth gubbins}
All the notes from the chord are unpacked and sent to separate oscillators.
A \verb+[phasorblock]+ each contains 4 phasors so we have one half of
the chord going to the left side, and the other to the right side
of a stereo chorus/delay. The amplitude decay time of the synth, which
is processed by \verb+[stereoamp]+, is set to
4 times the current period, so it will move automatically if there
is any tempo change. Locking synth parameters to global variables
like tempo is very useful, you may have many lfos all running
in synchrony if you use a fast timebase by running the metro
at 16 times the drum speed to broadcast a \verb+time+ value from
which message rate lfos can be derived.
