\paragraph{opposite volume for left and right}
The value on \verb+[inlet pan]+
is first rescaled from degrees to a normalised range.
A proper pan uses cosine fades for equal power panning, but this 
panner is easier to understand and fine for most things. The left and
right volume control values are opposites of each other so when
the left pan signal is 1 the right is 0.
