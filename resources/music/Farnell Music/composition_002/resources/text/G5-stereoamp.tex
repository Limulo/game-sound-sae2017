\paragraph{long amplitude envelope}
To control both left and right outputs of
the chorus together we need a stereo 
envelope. The control signal holds
for about twice the decay time, which
in this case is 16 times the period. Look
back to the \verb+[padsynth]+ to see we
used 4 times the period. This gives a soft
fall to the pads so they don't play
in a constant dirge, slightly more string-like
than organ.
