\paragraph{phasor bank}
Bunching up a load of osc sources in one signal abstraction is quite typical
but with phasors we need to remember to remove the DC offset
because a phasor is not symmetrical about zero. There are clever
ways to reuse a \verb+[mtof]+ if we have lists of notes, but it
is a very inexpensive unit so we opt to have separate inlets
and separate \verb+[mtof]+ for each voice.
