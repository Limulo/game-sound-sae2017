## README

The patch to open up first is `SwordDemo.pd`. This is the GUI allowing you to adjust all the components. The patch `CwordCorInterp.pd` is what works under in the background and contains all the equations and sound sources. Feel free to modify the patch as desired.

The folder `SwordSounds` contains all the sound files that were used in the listener perceptual evaluation test. This includes the sounds of the reduced physics model, _LoQ1_ and _LoQ2_.

The pre-set *PGA* is the synthesis of a golf swinging through the air which includes a simple additive synthesis sound of a golf ball being struck. The *MLB* pre-set is the synthesis of a baseball bat swing.
