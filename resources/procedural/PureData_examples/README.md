# Pure Data procedural examples

This folder contains a series of pure data patches, each of which synthetizes a particular sound effect.

Most of the patches are designed by _Andy J. Farnel_ as taken from his book "_Designing Sound_" (his original files are also contained inside the **ds\_pd\_examples.tar.gz** archive in this same folder). 
Other patches are made by _Alexey Reshetnikov_, _Rod Selfridge_ and _Nicola Ariutti_.
All patches are edited by Nicola Ariutti and adapted to be used during the "Game Engine, Game Sound" lessons.

## Pure data & additional libraries

In order to use these patch you need a copy of [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/)
 
You need also to install some additional libraries (you can donwload them from the official [Pure Data repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pure-data/) ):
* list\_abs (for the **[list\_dot]** and **[list_emath]** objects);
* zexy (for the **[>~]** and **[<~]** object);
* iemlib (**[prvu~]**, **[init]**, **[t3_bpe]**, **[t3_line~]** and **[t3_delay]** objects);
* motex (**[ln~]** object);
* lyonpotpourri (**[adsr~]** object);
* creb (**[ead~]** object);
* cxc, cyclone, purepd (**[Uzi]**, **[acos]**, **[atan~]**, **[delta~]** objects);
* ggee (**[image]** object);
* hid (**[hid]** object);
