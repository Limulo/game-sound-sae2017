===============================================================================

15/02/17 1.09.02 - Studio Tool major release (build 84334)
----------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed a crash when pasting a multi sound into a paused event.


09/02/17 1.09.01 - Studio Tool major release (build 84153)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Main windows will now darken when a modal dialog is present, to hint when
  they have been disabled.
* Update profiler graph hover labels to more descriptive of each displayed
  data stream. Label will also indicate when no data is present for a given
  data graph.

Fixes:
* Fixed event scheduling mode is not updated correctly when sound is deleted
  from track.
* Fixed issue where users could drop files from their operating system into 
  Studio while a modal dialog was active.
* Fixed profiler graph resolution not being refreshed when they are resized
  vertically.


01/12/16 1.09.00 - Studio Tool major release (build 82164)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added the Multiband EQ effect. This is a highly efficient effect featuring
  five toggleable bands that can be set to lowpass, highpass, shelf, peaking,
  band-pass, all-pass and notch modes.
* Added all-new sound module playback visualization. It is now possible to
  clearly see the playback state of sound modules when triggered on the
  timeline or via a parameter. This greatly simplifies designing and
  debugging event playback.
* Sound modules have been visually revamped to show loop points more clearly,
  as well as the zero-crossing line for waveforms. Multi sounds and scatterer
  sounds will now display a preview of their playlist items in their trigger
  regions, providing playlist information at a glance.
* Added explicit control over synchronous (time-locked) and asynchronous
  playback of sound modules (which was previously dictated by the looping
  state). This can be accessed via the 'Async' button in the sound module deck.
* Added support for synchronous multi sounds.
* Added support for non-looping single sounds which play back synchronously.
  This is useful when trying to avoid wrap-around when applying pitch
  randomization.
* Improved the event creation workflow. You can now create a new 3D or 2D
  event directly, or pick from a user-defined list of Default Events. Default
  Events can be added via the Event context menu. The new workflow applies when
  creating event in the browser, or creating events implicitly by dragging
  audio files into the events browser.
* Improved the multi sound playlist interface. Playlists now have full support
  for multi-selecting items, including removing or setting the play percentage
  of items in batch.
* Added support for copy and pasting sound modules to and from playlists.
* Playlist items now display their implicit play percentages if any of their
  siblings have a play percentage assigned.
* Added support for adding empty single sounds to the playlist of a multi
  sound to indicate silences.
* Added support for multi-channel impulse responses for the Convolution
  Reverb effect.
* Add support for assigning events to VCAs.
* Added a buttons bar to the bottom of all browsers, playlists, and condition
  lists, providing quick access to commonly used menu commands.
* Added support for automation of modulator properties.
* Added support for asymmetric seek speed. This allows a separate seek speed
  to be set for ascending and descending changes.
* Added support for displaying the stretched waveform of synchronous sounds
  that have a static pitch change applied.
* Added a total event count to Instances profiler graph, which includes
  instances which are not currently playing.

Fixes:
* Fixed incorrect playback volume for sounds and playlist items whose volume
  property is set to a non-zero dB value.
* Improved smoothness of metering levels when connected via live update.
* Fixed auditioning of programmer sounds with looping enabled.

Notes:
* Synchronous single sounds will no longer be looping by default when they
  are added. Use the loop button in the deck to enable looping as required.
* Incremented runtime bank version, requires Studio API 1.09.00 or later.
* Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.
* Disconnected sidechain modulators are now inactive. Previous behavior
  was to fall back to monitoring the event's master track output.


02/12/16 1.08.16 - Studio Tool minor release
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* The marker track view will now only expand to the height of eight marker 
  tracks. Additional marker tracks will cause a vertical scrollbar to appear, 
  allowing the user to view all existing marker tracks. 
* Support using the paste shortcut when any areas of the window accept the
  clipboard contents for paste. For example, you can now have the events
  browser in while still pasting tracks to the selected event.

Fixes:
* Fixed instance polyphony not being applied to the master bus correctly
  following a project reload.
* Fixed Studio continuing to attempt login to Perforce server even though if
  server has returned a password error.
* Fixed commit dialog popping up during "Sync Latest & Merge Project" after
  attempting to commit project.
* Fixed intermittent crash when closing project introduced in 1.08.11.
* Fixed crash when playing back events at very high zoom levels.
* Fixed support for dynamically reloading plugins when the plugin directory
  setting is modified and certain plugins are no longer available.
* Fixed rare crash occuring when shutting down the application.
* Fixed Studio not cleaning up .restore backup directories properly after
  saving.
* Fixed deleted projects showing up in the "Browse for Project" dialog.
* Fixed the label in the audio file preview not eliding text correctly.
* Fixed crash when undoing duplicating of folder with events.
* Fixed importing profiler session results in validation error if the session
  was exported by the same user trying to import.
* Fixed SVN integration incorrectly reporting out of sync when saving project
  after changing project settings.
* Improved performance of SVN integration when syncing and during browsing
  in the project.
* Fixed the paste shortcut pasting into the previously selected track under
  some circumstances.
* Fixed issue where dragging a selection from the routing browser into a mixer 
  view would not add any descendant items in the selsction to the mixer view.
* Fixed Batch Rename script example not always filtering correctly when
  prepending or appending.

Notes:
* Studio no longer prevents committing to source control if the project
  contains validation errors. Users can opt to validate and repair their
  project at a later stage.
* Relative property bulk edits will no longer be the default type of property
  edit. Changes are now absolute by default and will only be relative if you
  are holding the shift modifier. Relative property bulk edit has also been
  disabled when a property is edited via text entry.


01/12/16 1.08.15 - Studio Tool minor release (build 82163)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Events, sound modules and audio tables can now be opened in the user's choice
  of windows via the context menu.
* Added new scripting bank building function that allows user to specify the
  banks and platforms to build.
* Added support to replace an audio file by dragging and dropping from platform
  browser a valid audio file of the same name and extension.

Fixes:
* Fixed pops occuring at the end of very short waveforms, when auditioned
  through the Assets tab, with the looping option turned off. This bug does not
  affect playback of events.
* Fixed crash when dragging in an asset from FMOD.IO right after saving a newly
  created project.
* Fixed value not committing when modifying certain percentage based randomizer
  modulator.
* Fixed audio table window to now correctly open a new audio table when already
  viewing an audio table.
* Fixed crash when opening a FMOD Designer project if any of the envelopes is
  hidden.
* Fixed unused label for audio file not updating correctly under certain
  circumstances for a loaded project.
* Fixed convolution reverb 'clear' functionality for the impulse data not
  working.
* Fixed on certain SVN server, locking of pending changes failed due to
  unhandled benign error message if user has already obtained the lock.
* Fixed bug where dragging on a tree view item's disclosure triangle could drag 
  the currently selected items.
* Fixed issue where modules obscured by scrolling the audio tracks view were 
  selectable by marquee selection in the marker tracks view.
* Fixed issue where saving was failing if the xml is already checked out by
  another user.
* Fixed issue where validating a project would cause items in the events browser 
  to be exapnded.


20/10/16 1.08.14 - Studio Tool minor release (build 80900)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added support for migration from FMOD Designer the channel mix effect.

Fixes:
* Fixed bug when pasting an event sound, any modulator or automation of the
  nested event parameters are not copied over to the newly pasted event sound.
* Fixed crash on Mac when using the Bring All to Front menu item when all
  windows are minimized.
* Fixed migration from FMOD Designer not converting sound instances with
  spawning sound def to the sound scatterer.
* Fixed autopitch modulator not behaving the way it used to be if the parameter
  minimum is greater than 0.

Notes:
* Autopitch modulator now behaves in 2 different modes. When migrating from
  FMOD Designer, autopitch will behave as it used to be in FMOD Designer (i.e.
  the modulation starts taking effect at parameter's minimum). If you are
  migrating from FMOD Designer, we highly recommend migrating using this 
  version. For FMOD Studio project, the modulation will start at parameter's
  zero and parameter with minimum value greater than zero will have the same
  pitch adjustment as before. These differences will be reconciled in next
  major release to match FMOD Designer behavior. 


04/10/16 1.08.13 - Studio Tool minor release (build 80479)
----------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed crash if sidechain was located above a compressor in the mixer bus
  hierarchy.
* Fixed serialized value for auto pitch at minimum not taking effect after 
  project load.
* Fixed profiler session not loading on Mac (bug introduced in 1.08.09).
* Fixed intermittent bank building generating invalid banks (size of 1kB) if
  the asset directory contains large number of unimported assets.
* Fixed bug where Studio incorrectly removes a parameter condition when 
  changing the range of its trigger parameter if the parameter condition's
  value is on the boundary of the new parameter range.


22/09/16 1.08.12 - Studio Tool minor release (build 80229)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added support for migrating from FMOD Designer "steal quietest" max playback
  behavior to event automatable properties voice stealing behavior.
* Added support for pitch at minimum to auto pitch modulator.

Fixes:
* Fixed setting the value of a property via text entry not adjusting
  corresponding automation curves correctly in some cases.
* Fixed crash when closing project while downloading assets from FMOD IO.
* Fixed changes to automation track visibility not getting propagated to other
  selected events when in bulk edit mode.
* Fixed crash when modifying effects chain in bulk edit mode after several
  undo redo of effect creation.
* Prevent crash occurring when loading a malformed profiler session.
* Fixed crash when undoing while renaming an audio track or marker. (Mac only).

Notes:
* Incremented runtime bank version, requires Studio API 1.08.00 or later.
* Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.


23/08/16 1.08.11 - Studio Tool minor release
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added proper support for "Copy Effect to All" for mixer bus fader. This now
  replaces the automation and modulation of the equivalent faders with the
  automation and modulation of the current fader. It also sets the volume
  of the faders to match.
* Added new #modified search term to filter any audio file that has a differing
  channel count and/or length to the value in the metadata.

Fixes:
* Fixed crash on 64-bit when encoding 16kHz or 24kHz sources using Vorbis at 
  low quality settings.
* Fixed crash when migrating project to 1.08 if the project contains invalid
  bank metadata file.
* Fixed search text not being updated correctly when using the "Find
  References..." menu item.
* Fixed bug where Perforce integration would consider Perforce workspace 
  invalid if the project folder name does not match the fspro name and the 
  folder containing the project folder is not in the workspace mapping.
* Fixed issue where marquee selection could not select automation points that
  were precisely on the edges of a parameter.
* Fixed bug where transition region quantization markings were only being drawn
  in beats display mode.
* Fixed crash when channel count of the current audio file in Asset View has
  changed and the length of the audio file is under a certain threshold.
* Fixed bug on Mac when a project is opened via "Open Recent..." and the 
  project path contains non English character, Studio would error out on save.


22/08/16 1.08.10 - Studio Tool minor release (build 79252)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Dragging an automation point with the alt modifier key now vertically
  constrains selected points. This replaces the previous behaviour where 
  alt-clicking would delete an automation point.
* Added support for dragging multiple markers across tracks simultaneously.
* Added support for relative paths (relative to the Asset directory) when
  importing audio files via scripting.
* Added a menu bar item to jump to FMOD.io.
* Added support for setting polyphony on the master bus.
* Added "PathLineEdit" widget type to scripting. It provides a single-line
  text entry and a "Browse" button that brings up a path selection dialog.
* Added new setting for Perforce script based integration that allows user
  to specify a different location for the p4 executable. When unspecified,
  default location is "/usr/local/bin/p4" on Mac OSX and on Windows, it will
  be the first available p4.exe based on the PATH environment variable.

Fixes:
* Fixed issue with incrementing the duration value in move-to dialogs when
  viewed in beats display mode.
* Fixed scriptable UI combo box not committing manual entry changes if focus
  is changed via clicking on other UI elements.
* Fixed intermittent expansion of folders occuring in browsers when deleting
  items or when making assignment changes to banks, VCAs or tags.
* Fixed crash during building if there is a mismatch bit depth in the assets.


01/08/16 1.08.09 - Studio Tool minor release (build 78489)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Browser selection will now take effect on mouse release. This allows for
  creation of referenced event trigger regions without requiring a second
  event browser to be opened.
* Added new option "-script" to the commandline tool to support automated
  project processing via scripting.
* Added option to switch the time display mode of the transport bar, move-to 
  dialogs and the timeline ruler using buttons in the transport bar. 
* Time values presented on the transport bar and move-to dialogs can now be 
  incremented using the up and down keys or a vertical mouse drag.
* The #unassigned filter will now exclude referenced events.
* Added support for dragging multiple modules across audio tracks 
  simultaneously.

Fixes:
* Fixed intermittent crashes when selecting and dragging items within the
  browser, often occurring when a load is triggered. This also fixes issues
  with queued mouse presses not being handled correctly while loading is in
  progress.
* Selection of browser items on Mac is now more consistent with the Windows
  implementation. For example, opening a context menu will select the clicked
  item before being shown.
* Fixed Studio crashing for a new project if the user account name contains
  foreign character not found in the system locale.
* Improved build time when multiple editors for the same project are opened.
* Improved time taken to delete folder containing large number of events.
* Fixed Studio not cleaning up obsolete folders when migrating from a project
  that is of version 1.05 or older.
* Fixed accuracy issue with interpolated value between two placed automation 
  points for dB based automation curves.
* Fixed automations not being trimmed correctly when dragging a number box
  control.
* Fixed the active snapshot not being cleared from the browser correctly when
  navigating back to the mixing desk via the breadcrumbs widget.
* Fix recently introduced bug that caused rerouting bus to master bus via
  drag and drop to bail out without doing anything.

Notes:
* The Two Big Ears 3Dception trial has been removed from the plug-ins list as
  it is no longer supported.
* Controls which cannot be scoped into a snapshot, such as buttons and
  dropdowns, will now display their baseline values, even when viewed in the
  context of a snapshot.


14/07/16 1.08.08 - Studio Tool minor release (build 77846)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added support for auditioning assets with their final compression settings.
  This can be enabled by clicking the "Compress" button below the audio file
  display.
* Added support for looping auditioning of assets. This can be enabled by
  clicking the "Loop" button below the audio file display.
* Metering information is now displayed along with fader values in the birds
  eye view of the mixing desk.
* Added option to enable include sub directories for audio tables. The keys
  of the entries will be the relative path separated by forward slash.
* Improved accuracy of FMOD Designer envelope migration. Studio now uses additional
  points and the diamond handles to better approximate the different curve
  types found in FMOD Designer.
* Added support for importing FMOD Designer's Time Offset to module's Start Offset.
  Note: the Start Offset in Studio is in percentage of the audio asset's length
  or in the case of multisound, the percentage of the shortest audio asset's
  length. Studio will clamp the value of the original envelope in Designer to 
  make sure all parts of the curve is within the range of 0 to 100%.

Fixes:
* Fixed looping sounds in a multi sound playlist failing to stop if the multi
  sound itself is non-looping.
* Fixed Asset browser losing focus after a rename of items resulting in 
  browser not responding to arrow keys.
* Fixed various errors and omissions in the FMOD Studio User Manual.
* Fixed project packaging function not including the master bank binary when
  the "Banks" option is enabled.
* Fixed crash when setting the Impulse Response on the convolution reverb.
* Fixed issue where after migrating a project and saving, the events can
  fail to load and present itself in the editor (can be worked around by 
  reloading the project).
* Fixed issue where renaming an asset folder with unimported audio files
  results in the unimported audio files going missing from the view. Instead
  Studio now attempts to import them prior to renaming.
* Fixed bug where the "Open" button in the Browse for Project... dialog 
  remains greyed out under certain circumstances.
* Fixed Perforce integration not prompting user to resolve conflict if the
  project was synced outside of Studio.
* Fixed Perforce integration returning an error when attempting to resolve
  conflict by accepting the server version.
* Fixed the automatic input format not being computed correctly when placing
  modules on the master track.
* Fixed the drag drop indicator sometimes being drawn at the wrong location
  in the browser.

Notes:
* Newly created events will no longer send to the global Reverb return by
  default.


27/06/16 1.08.07 - Studio Tool minor release (build 77241)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Improved the timecode display such that individual components can be edited
  directly via keyboard input. This includes positions displayed in measures.
* Increased the pixel area of which named markers and tempo markers can be
  double-clicked. This makes it easier to edit their values.
* Studio now supports recovering of invalid global mixer group and return.

Fixes:
* Fixed issue with certain plugins appearing to be incompatible after reloading
  a project.
* Fixed "Save As" failing if an attempt to "Save" has failed after modifying
  the project.
* Fixed crash when attempting to paste multiple single sounds onto a game
  parameter if their start positions are not unique.
* Fixed labels on the timeline ruler being displayed incorrectly for certain
  measures.


17/06/16 1.08.06 - Studio Tool minor release (build 76937)
----------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Further fixes have been made to the email client used for the Contact Us
  dialog and Crash Reporter, due to problems with some users being unable to
  send from certain locations. Improvements have also been made to better
  explain when an email fails to send.
* Fixed "Identify Local Changes..." in Perforce not detecting all the changes.
* Fixed live update not connecting to older runtimes (1.08.00 to 1.08.02).


15/06/16 1.08.05 - Studio Tool minor release (build 76824)
----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Detection of incompatible DSP plugins has been improved, such that placed
  instances must strictly match the loaded plugin's description. As a result,
  some older projects may have their placed plugin instances flagged as
  incompatible. To assist with this, this version also adds a new plugin repair
  utility (see below) which can be used to safely migrate old plugin instances.

Features:
* Improved build progress granularity when building banks.
* Linked the active selection in the Buses browser to the editor selection, in
  the Mixer window.
* Changed the alignment of the Trigger Behavior tab so that it stays in place
  when opened.
* Added functionality to import a profiler session from a Studio generated
  zip package.
* Added support for repairing plugin instances when a plugin description
  changes or a plugin DLL has been removed. This can be done by clicking on
  the deck widget of the corresponding plugin instance. Plugins can be
  repaired per instance, or optionally, repaired across an entire project.
* Improved support for high-DPI displays on Windows.

Fixes:
* Fixed the email client for the Contact Us dialog and Crash Reporter (this
  had been disabled due to issues with our underlying email service).
* Fixed Studio generating unused {????????-????-????-????-????????????} folder
  in the profiler user data folder when loading a project.
* Fixed issue where the type ordering in browser can sometimes be violated 
  after moving items around.
* Fixed stall when creating a new profiler session if there are existing 
  profiler sessions.
* Fixed verbose logging not outputting low level logs on Mac.
* Fixed migration from 1.07 not generating unique asset names if 2 or more
  assets have the same path with differing cases.
* Fixed extended selection not working properly right after Audio Bin view is
  opened via "Open in Audio Bin".
* Fixed some omissions and errors within the FMOD Studio User Manual.
* Fixed Designer effects migrated via plugin not having the correct automation
  curve and hence incorrect interpolation.
* Fixed Perforce integration not reporting an error if there is no available
  workspace when P4HOST is set.
* Fixed Perforce integration not using the environment variables as default.
* Fixed Perforce integration not logging in if a valid user and password has
  been specified.
* Fixed crash in "Source Control->Browse for Project..." dialog when clicking
  the "Open" button if the connection details was changed after a selection
  has been made.
* Fixed Asset view behaving weird after a new folder named "New Folder" is
  created if there already exists a "New Folder (<number>)".


25/05/16 1.08.04 - Studio Tool minor release (build 76196)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Revamped the event macros interface so that macros are displayed alongside
  the master track effect deck. This makes it easy to add or remove the 3D
  panner and simplifies management of the effect deck selection. The master
  track will also be displayed when nothing is selected within the event.
* Added the 'Steal Quietest' stealing behavior for events and group buses. This
  causes the quietest event to be stopped and replaced with a new event, when
  the event instance limit is exceeded.
* Improved the user interface for the package project dialog.

Fixes:
* Save as now works even if the original project has files that are read
  only.
* Fixed intermittent issue where audio assets not getting restored properly
  after a save failure during the migration of a project.
* Fixed path line edits being cleared when cancelling out of the file select
  dialog.
* Fixed the sandbox and profiler API playback not using the same audio output
  device that is selected in the preferences window.
* Fixed issues loading plugins that reside in file paths containing non-ascii
  characters.
* Fixed sustain point in Designer project not getting migrated properly.
* Fixed sound def instance's volume not getting migrated from Designer to 
  Studio.
* Fixed audio assets not getting the correct length, channel count and sampling
  rate when migrating from a Designer project.
* Fixed SVN integration to use the preferred path for Mac and Windows. On 
  Windows it relies on location of svn.exe to be included in PATH environment
  variable and on Mac it looks for svn in /usr/bin.
* Fixed incorrect command option used for conflict resolve in SVN script.
* Fixed incorrect command option used for checkin in SVN script.

Notes:
* Incremented runtime bank version, requires Studio API 1.08.00 or later.
* Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.


05/05/16 1.08.03 - Studio Tool minor release (build 75571)
----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Added new FMOD Studio Getting Started Guide. This can be opened via the
  Help > Getting Started Guide menu item.

Features:
* Added support for complex queries in the browser filter. You can now filter
  the events browser for events containing a particular parameter or effect,
  and filter the assets browser by audio file length. Filter suggestions have
  been added to the loupe menu.
* Added support for cooldown time for events. This is visible in the event
  macros deck. The cooldown time specifies the minimum time before another
  event of the same type can be played. This is useful for events that are
  triggered rapidly. This is set to zero (disabled) by default.
* Added an option to package a project or an individual profiler session to a
  zip file. Packages optionally include audio assets, profiler sessions and
  built banks. This can be initiated by from the File > Package Project... menu
  item to package an entire project, or via the Package Selection... context
  menu items for individual profiler sessions.
* Updated the AHDSR interface to include number boxes for each component. This
  makes it easier to edit components independently.
* Added support for bulk editing AHDSR values.
* Removed restrictions that prevent adding certain types of effects more than
  once to a given effect chain.
* Improved the accuracy of mouse selection in the profiler lifespans view. The
  selected lifespan will be drawn on top always.
* Added a context menu item to modify a snapshot's behavior after it has been
  created.
* Added an a build settings option to disable including audio file names within
  built banks.
* Added support for creating editable combo boxes via the scripting API. 
  Setting the "isEditable" property to true will make it editable and the state 
  can be queried via isEditable function.
* Added support to the scripting API to query if the operating system is
  Windows or Mac OSX. The studio.os.platform property will return either "win"
  or "mac" respectively.
* The user combo box of Perforce setting is now editable. This will allow users 
  using the Helix Cloud to type in the desired user name. 

Fixes:
* Fixed bulk edit not working correctly if the property is being modulated by
  more than one modulator.
* Fixed crash when validating project if the project contains Mixer View with
  events assigned to it.
* Fixed Audio Bin view allowing unsupported file types to be dragged in.
* Fixed shortcut key not working for Open in External Sample Editor.
* Fixed intermittent crash when dragging and dropping mixer input.
* Fixed programmer sound without a placeholder incorrectly setting the channel
  format to surround. Now defaults to mono.
* Fixed extended selection in Asset view not using the current after a "Open
  in Audio Bin" operation.
* Fixed the browser keyboard shortcuts for collapsing/expanding folders not
  working when the browser is in focus but an event editor is opened.
* Vertical markers in the multi-track editor fixed to align precisely with the 
  parameter ruler markings.
* Fixed crash when attempting to drag and drop a folder from Finder onto the
  Asset view.
* Fixed crash when attempting to drag and drop audio assets between projects.
  This operation is not supported and user should instead use Finder or
  Windows Explorer to copy audio assets between projects.
* Reduced the jittering of panners when changing bus selection.
* Fixed platforms still appearing in the platforms list after being removed,
  when following a rename.
* Fixed auditioning UI not working for audio table.
* Fixed surround panner speakers being disabled after switching platforms.
* Fixed crash when pressing the delete key immediately after deleting an entry 
  from the multisound playlist.
* Fixed new Perforce integration not populating the users combo box correctly
  on Mac due to differences in definition of newline on Mac and Windows.
* Fixed profiler levels graphs sometimes not resetting to zero properly.
* Fixed various minor errors and missing sections in FMOD Studio User Manual.

Notes:
* Incremented runtime bank version, requires Studio API 1.08.00 or later.
* Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.
* To avoid confusion, Audio Bin view no longer supports XM or OXM files to be
  imported. XM and OXM files are played back and converted to ogg internally
  when building which is not really the behavior user might expect (i.e. the
  XM or OXM files are packaged without modification). If the previous behavior
  is desired, users should convert the file to one of the supported formats 
  prior to importing.


13/04/16 1.08.02 - Studio Tool minor release (build 74770)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added indicators to transition markers that contain a transition timeline.
* Added minimum and maximum text to the automation track ruler.
* Added custom UI for VisiSonics spatialization plugin.

Fixes:
* Fixed unnecessary up/down mix applied to 2D events that have sidechain
  modulators.
* Fixed issue with Perforce integration for plugin that under certain 
  circumstances Studio would alter the file type of plugin to text instead
  of binary.
* Fixed crash when closing an editor view if there is effects that are
  currently selected.
* Fixed depot project dialog not refreshing properly if source control provider
  has no user modifiable settings in UI.


07/04/16 1.08.01 - Studio Tool minor release (build 74554)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Drag and drop from IO view onto the Asset view is now supported.
* Added progress indicator to audio audition view when downloading an audio
  file from FMOD.io.
* Added a warnings indicator to display when a selected audio device is unable
  to be initialized.
* Added clear all button to multisound playlist.
* Added multiselect support to the multisound playlist. The shift and  ctrl
  modifiers can be held to select additional items.

Fixes:
* Fixed Studio not parsing the commas separated keys.txt correctly to populate
  the audio table.
* Fixed hang or crash when loading a .it file or mod file as a sound.
* Fixed Perforce integration incorrectly reporting workspace is not suitable
  if project name contains white spaces.
* Fixed the loading progress indicator in the status bar not updating on Mac.
* Fixed crash when an illegal character is entered in the platform output
  sub-directory and Studio loses focus (e.g. switching between different
  application).
* Fixed Studio incorrectly reporting an error when importing an audio assets
  that is already imported.

04/03/16 1.08.00 - Studio Tool major release (build 73609)
----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Launched FMOD.io. You can now login and purchase assets via the FMOD.io tab
  in the Audio Bin window.
* The project file format has changed significantly. Please use the in-built
  migration option when opening older projects.

Features:
* Added the 3D Object Panner effect to allow events to be spatialized using
  Dolby Atmos and Playstation VR technology.
* Added tool support for loading custom output plugins and codec plugins.
* All-new asset management workflow. Files are now mapped to physical
  locations on disk, greatly simplifying working with audio files. Finding
  and replacing files in the Assets folder structure is quick and easy, as
  they always match the structure you see in Studio. The Assets folder can be
  mapped to a network drive, or stored separately from the project metadata.
* New files are automatically detected when added on disk to the Assets
  folder. This allow you to set up your DAW to build directly into your
  project's Assets folder. The assets view also supports filtering by newly
  detected files.
* Added the 'Consolidate' context menu. This is available when selecting
  multiple audio files in the assets browser and allows you to replace old
  assets with new ones, or merge multiple existing assets.
* Revamped management of encoding settings. Encoding settings can now be
  specified on a per platform, per folder, and per asset basis from the Assets
  browser. Assets can be assigned custom encoding settings directly, or can
  inherit settings more broadly by setting encoding settings at the folder
  or platform level.
* Added support for customizing available platforms for a project including
  support for multiple platform configurations for the same hardware type.
  Adding new platforms to your project can be configured from the Preferences
  dialog. Build output directory, speaker format, and default encoding settings
  can all be set on a per platform basis.
* Added a status bar. This includes new incators for live update connection
  status, a validation warnings indicator, and a loading progress bar.
* Added active platform selector to the status bar. This allows for building
  to a single platform, auditioning events in their platform speaker format,
  and adding per platform encoding settings in the assets browser.
* Added a 'Build All Banks...' option to the menu bar. This will build all
  banks across every platform. The 'Build' menu bar item will now build just
  the banks required for the active platform.  
* Added support for left-edge trimming. You can now drag the left edge of
  time-locked single sounds to trim away the head of an Asset, accurate to
  samples. This process is non-destructive, much the same as trimming the
  tail of a file.
* Added an offset field to the 'Move To...' dialog to support left-edge
  trimming.
* Added support for setting a start offset as a percentage of a module's
  content. This allows for setting a start offset that will scale based on the
  selected content, for example, scaling the offset based on the sound selected
  in a multi sound playlist. This allows for automation and modulation of
  start offset over the entire duration of the sound. This complements the
  newly added support for time-locked left-edge trimming.
* Added support for splitting sound modules. This occurs at either the context
  menu position or at the cursor position, when executed via the menu bar item.
* Added a command for replacing a single sound with the trimmed audio. Sounds
  that have been non-destructively trimmed on the timeline can be replaced with
  a trimmed copy of the asset, using the 'Replace Audio with Trimmed Copy'
  context menu item.
* Added support for snapping automation points to neighboring points, making
  it easier to create vertical segments in automation curves.
* Added the assets browser tab in event editor. The assets browser tab has
  been added to the Event Editor window for quick access to audio files.
* Added support for the 'Decompressed' loading mode. At runtime, this allows
  for assets to be decompressed into PCM data when they are loaded, rather
  than being decoded as they are played. This complements the existing
  'Compressed' and 'Streaming' loading modes. The 'Decompressed' loading mode
  can only be applied as a per platform encoding setting, under the
  'Advanced Loading Mode' drop-down.
* Added support for profiling file I/O. A new graph is available in the master
  track of each profiler session, indicating disk bandwidth usage for bank
  loading, sample loading, and asset streaming.
* Added indicators to event instances in the lifespans view of the profiler.
  You can now inspect when events have been delayed due to file I/O, or when
  they have been restarted via code.
* Added a new script-based source control plugin interface. Source control
  can easily be integrated via Javascript.
* Added SVN integration (Beta), backing onto the new script-based source
  control plugin interface.
* AT9 Band Extension is now enabled by default for supported bit-rates.

Notes:
* Incremented runtime bank version, requires Studio API 1.08.00 or later.
* Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.
* AT9 compression now requires AT9 library 1.7.1 (DLL version 2.8.0.5) or later. 
  Compression in 32bit versions of Studio is no longer supported in line with 
  Sony's removal of 32bit compression libraries.
* As the assets browser now mirrors files on disk, operations such as renaming,
  moving, and deleting of audio files are no longer undoable.


03/03/16 1.07.08 - Studio Tool minor release (build 73591)

  that action.
* Fixed bug where Studio was not marking the new audio asset for add after
  using the "Replace" function. 
* Fixed bug where Studio incorrectly migrated 3D Pan Level automation from
  Designer even though the event is 2D which resulted in an invalid automation
  curve.
* Fixed the device list becoming empty when a broken output device is selected
  in the preferences dialog.

Notes:
* Build warning pertaining to missing plugins now list the referencing events
  and buses.

  workspace view contains mapping to an invalid drive.
* Fixed bug when finding project in Perforce server, Studio was not looking at
  the immediate folder specified in the workspace view.
* Fixed bug where Perforce workspace will be considered not suitable for
  project if the project folder instead of its ancestor folder is mapped in
  the workspace view.
* Fixed bug where Studio would mark the metadata of a newly created event for 
  add prior to saving which can result in dangling changes for non existance 
  files.
* Fixed crash when deleting a profiler session while it is in the process of
  recording.
* Fixed Studio not terminating on shutdown if ASIO is selected as the audio 
  device.
* Fixed issue while dragging or resizing the birds eye view widget and

  is currently only available via migration for legacy purpose. Adding
  a new instance is not supported.


27/01/16 1.07.06 - Studio Tool minor release (build 71893)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added event mixer strips to the mixer desk. This reintroduces some of the
  previous mixer input functionality, such as the ability to meter, solo and
  mute events, and scope events into mixer views. You can also quickly view the
  event macros for selected event strips.
* The shift key can be held to multi-select track heads in the multitrack
  editor.

Fixes:

11/12/15 1.07.04 - Studio Tool minor release (build 70728)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added indicators to highlight events that have been referenced and events
  that have not been assigned to a bank, in the browser view. A similar
  indicator has been added the audio bin to visualize which files aren't used.
* Extended support for the "Find references..." command. For example, you can
  find all snapshots that reference a particular bus, find all audio files
  referenced by a particular event, or find all VCAs that affect a particular
  strip.
* Added a "Find sends..." option for return buses. This allows you to filter
  the events browser by items that send to a particular return bus. You can
  also filter the routing browser to find other buses sending to a return.
* Added support for quantization intervals of up to eight bars for sounds and
  transition regions.
* Added support for keying off sustain points in the sandbox.
* Improved the performance and responsiveness of the browser view.
* Improved reliability of live update connect.
* Improved indicators for when a plug-in is missing.

Notes:
* "Refresh Event Sound Parameters" has been renamed to "Refresh Referenced
  Parameters" to better match the functionality of refreshing the list of 
  parameters available on a event sound or snapshot module. This can be used 
  to correct a module going out of sync with the event or snapshot it refers to,
  which can happen when multiple users make conflicting edits.


17/11/15 1.07.03 - Studio Tool minor release (build 69975)
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Added the Transceiver effect. Sends signals from multiple sources to a single 
  'channel' (like a radio station, up to 32 of them) and receieve from that or 
  any channel from multiple receivers. Great for receiving and broadcasting 
  a submix from multiple 3D locations (for example, it can be used to 3D
  position a reverb bus signal inside an event).

05/10/15 1.07.00 - Studio Tool major release (build 68517)
----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Studio is now a 64-bit application, providing greater memory capacity and
  improved performance. On Windows, separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions are
  available. On Mac, Studio is now 64-bit only.
* All plugin libraries must be built for 64-bit architecture in order to be
  compatible with the 64-bit version of Studio.
* The project file format has changed significantly. Please use the in-built
  migration option when opening older projects.
* The Studio tool now supports tracking of anonymous user analytics. This data
  will assist us in refining interface discoverability and tracking performance
  within the tool. Users can opt-out at any time via the About dialog.

Features:
* Added new scripting system, allowing users to control the interface and
  modify project data via a JavaScript API. Scripts can be run from the
  console window, assigned to menu bar items, or triggered remotely from a
  level editor or external application. Script files with the *.js extension
  will be searched for in the following directories: %appinstalldir%/Scripts,
  %systemuserdir%/FMOD Studio/Scripts, and %projectdir%/Scripts.
* Added support for marquee selection and movement of multitrack items. This
  includes moving markers, regions, and automation points in unison.
* Added support for snapping within the multitrack, including snapping to the
  ruler, cursor, playhead and other markers, regions, modules and loop points.
* Greatly improved project load times. Projects now load 4 to 5 times faster.
* Added support for finding all references to an event or audio file.
* Added polyphony controls to mixer groups, allowing you to limit the number
  event instances routed into a group.
* Improved nested event workflow. Nested events are now displayed under their
  parents within the browser. Added support for creating multiple references
  to a nested event. Added support for converting a nested event to a global
  event. Added support for converting a global event sound reference to a
  nested event by making a nested copy.
* Added support for profiling of snapshots and their intensities.
* Added profiler support for capturing the timeline position of event
  instances. This can be viewed in the deck, once an instance is selected.
* Added an option to filter by referenced events, within the event browser.
* Added support for moving the parameter cursor with the left and right keys.
  The control modifier can be held to move in finer increments.
* Added a new Channel Mix effect. This allows you to set per channel gain
  adjustments, and specify an input channel grouping.  User can control
  gain levels for up to 32 input channel signals (ie use a 32ch .wav file), 
  and pipe the output to a range of repeating speaker format modes.  Ie an 
  8ch signal can be represented as 4 stereo tracks, and the gain sliders can 
  be used to fade them in and out, for synced multi track interactive music.
* Studio now comes with AudioGaming's AudioMotors and Two Big Ears' 3Dception
  as built-in trial plugins. Both have include a customized deck interface.
* Panels within the properties pane can now be collapsed.
* Added a welcome dialog which is displayed the first time a new version of
  Studio is opened. This dialog also replaces the existing About dialog.
* Added support for horizontal scroll wheels. This includes horizontal
  scrolling with trackpads.
* Improved support for scroll wheels that track delta values with less than
  1/8th of a rotation, such as the Mac trackpad.

Notes:
* Incremented runtime bank version, requires Studio API 1.07.00 or later.
* Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.
* Mixer inputs have been deprecated; please use mixer groups to achieve the
  same effect. This allows for a more streamlined workflow, whilst also
  facilitates runtime optimizations. Old projects containing modified mixer
  inputs have been migrated to work with mixer groups.
* Renamed command line tool for Windows from fmodstudio.com to fmodstudio.exe
* Project open and save dialogs now point to the most recent location
* The polyphony stealing option "Quietest" has been renamed to "Virtualize",
  and the option "Off" has been renamed to "None". This more accurately
  describes their respective behaviors.
* Studio will now search for plugin libraries (*.dll and *.dylib files)
  within the following directories: %appinstalldir%/Plugins,
  %systemuserdir%/FMOD Studio/Plugins, and %projectdir%/Plugins.
* Warnings about missing or trial plugins are now shown post build.
